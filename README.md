# Chess
Created in high school.  Requires two people to play.  Each person left clicks on the piece they want to move.  Orange squares pop up to show them where they can move.  They can either left click on the destination space or right click to reset and choose another piece.  The view swaps for each player between turns.  Check and checkmate are shown in the status bar at the bottom.
